User :
Users are individuals who can submit grievances and complaints through the system. They can track the progress and status of their complaints and receive updates.

DSDO (District Social Development Officer) :
DSDOs are responsible for reviewing and addressing the grievances submitted by users within their respective districts. They can prioritize, assign, and communicate with users to resolve the issues effectively.

Admin :
Administrators have the highest level of access. They manage user accounts, monitor the overall system, generate reports, and ensure the system operates smoothly.
